# Covid19 India Dashboard

This is a dashboard that analyzes the situation of Coronavirus in India made in React using Leaflet(react-leaflet) and deployed on Netlify. It uses the covid19india api from https://www.covid19india.org/.

## Project Goals
- To make a smart dashboard that keeps a track of the current situation of nCovid-19 in India in order to provide a context to the people and policymakers.
- To use skills learnt in GEOG458 and evaluate if I can make such a solution or not.
- Although the lockdown in India is almost over, I want to use this dashboard for people to see that the situation is still spreading and they should take precautions in their daily lives.
